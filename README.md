## 1.2 Text based games and RPG's

Text based games and RPG's usually go hand in hand, this is because text based games require some other form of functionality and entertainment factor as the game usually will not feature any form of graphics, RPG's offer an in depth adventure game that can add a character development and system that can keep the player entertained with the text based adventure. With RPG's there must be requirements that must be met for it to be successful, for example an RPG usually has a form of leveling system and item system.
